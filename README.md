working Title: star_wars_app
description: this app will be for those who have interest in the star wars films. The free online star wars api is called so that information is called about each of the star wars films available on the star wars API. Directors, producers, and realease dates of all the star wars films are readily avaialable, with options to request additional information. This information includes all characters, and all planets available in the swapi, as well as as those specific to certain movies. 
Hierarchy: components include "allcharacters" and "planets", which both handle the full lists of said items, and so are classes, needing to keep state. "Featuredplanets" and "characters" components are also classes as they too call the api for specific information and render it from state. For the same reason, the App.js is also a class. "MovieContainer", "movie", "header", and "footer" and the like, are functional classes, as they only render, without needing to hold information in state.
API: https://swapi.co/api/films
MVP: This app is an interactive, functional app, using react and react router only, that makes multiple API using AXIOS calls to various api endpoints. There are at least 6 components, utilizing both functional and class types. It is styled with CSS, and responsive to 3 screen sizes using media queries. It was deployed on github and on surge.





This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
